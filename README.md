**Final Year Project:** A completely client-side data visualisation and forecasting Android application.

**Built for an Android 9 device on a MacBook Air**

### Requirements ###
- Android Studio (Android Studio Bumblebee | 2021.1.1 Patch 3)
- An Android phone or virtual device running Android 9 (API level 28)
- Python installed on the build machine
    - For best results, use Python 3.8.x.

### Build instructions ###
- To avoid potential issues with PATH environment variables, set the path to your Python executable in the module level's build.gradle file here:

- For further explanation, including examples on Windows machines, see https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/android.html#buildpython

- Please note: The application will be built with an unlicensed version of Chaquopy. As a result, the application will only function for five minutes from the time Python is started.

While only buildPython needs to be adjusted, full details for Chaquopy setup are available in the documentation (https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/android.html#basic-setup).
